//nrf_reliable_datagram receiver and transmitter code is the current code that ia ma working on. The mega is the transmitter and the Arduino uno is the reciever. test_wire_receiver is the code that allows the Sparkfun redboard(same processor as an uno) to read the values coming from the Uno. the other ttwo receiver and transmitter codes are the old code that does not print to the serial moniter properly. The latter also does not apear to execute its entire void loop function.
